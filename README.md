### Hi there, I'm Sam! ðŸ‘‹

I am the founder of [BioRhythm Technologies](https://www.biorhythm.io/) and a software engineer based in the Greater New York City Area.

- Throughout my career, I worked as a backend developer, trainer, documentation writer and business analyst. I have experience in Java, JavaScript, NodeJs, React, Redux, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQL Server and Express.
- You'll notice from the wide range of projects that I love building all kinds of things! Check out the rest of my portfolio below and on GitHub!
